Kredila Education Loan Disbursement – Process and Delay Resolution

1. Disbursement SLA
• Domestic: 7-10 working days after complete documentation
• International: 10-15 working days (SWIFT, LRS compliance)
• Disbursement in installments per semester as per fee schedule

2. Why My Loan Is Not Disbursed? Common Reasons and Solutions

REASON 1: e-NACH or E-Mandate Not Activated
• Kredila requires active NACH mandate for EMI deduction
• Disbursement blocked until mandate is successful
• Solution: Complete NACH registration at branch or online; verify status in 2-3 days
• If rejected: Re-initiate; check bank account has sufficient balance for test debit

REASON 2: Document Incomplete or Verification Pending
• Missing demand letter from institution
• Fee structure or institute details not verified
• Solution: Submit institute demand letter with fee break-up; allow 3-5 days for verification
• Name mismatch: Affidavit of Identity required

REASON 3: PAN-Aadhaar Link Not Done
• RBI mandate: PAN must be linked to Aadhaar
• Solution: Link on incometax.gov.in; same-day resolution possible

REASON 4: Margin Money or First Installment Pending
• For loans above unsecured limit, margin (5-15%) must be paid first
• Solution: Pay margin as per sanction letter; disbursement proceeds 1-2 days after

REASON 5: CIBIL or Credit Check Pending
• Credit refresh required before each disbursement
• New default in co-applicant may halt disbursement
• Solution: Resolve any dues; credit update may take 7-14 days

REASON 6: Institute Confirmation Delayed
• Kredila verifies fee with institute directly in some cases
• Solution: Follow up with institute to send confirmation to Kredila; 5-7 days typical

REASON 7: Post-Dated Cheques or Security Documents
• PDCs required for unsecured loans
• Solution: Submit at branch; physical verification adds 2-3 days

REASON 8: LRS Limit (International Loans)
• Annual limit $250,000 USD per student
• Solution: Verify LRS utilization; may need to defer to next FY

3. Escalation
• Branch Manager: First point for status
• Customer Care: Available for escalation
• Grievance: Available for central redressal
• Delay > 15 days: Escalate to regional office

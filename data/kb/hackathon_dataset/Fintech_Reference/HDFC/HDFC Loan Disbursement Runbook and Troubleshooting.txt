HDFC Education Loan Disbursement Runbook – Process and Troubleshooting

1. Disbursement Process Overview
• SLA: Domestic disbursements within 48-72 hours of document completion
• International (LRS): 72-96 hours
• Trigger: Digital Loan Folder must be complete and locked

2. Pre-Disbursement Requirements (All must be fulfilled)
• Signed loan agreement (e-signed via Aadhaar/DigiLocker)
• Active e-NACH or e-Mandate for repayment setup
• Valid university fee schedule or Demand Letter
• CIBIL refresh (student + co-applicant) within 24 hours
• Post-dated cheques received (if applicable for unsecured loans)

3. Common Reasons for Disbursement Delay (15+ days)

REASON 1: e-NACH / e-Mandate Rejection or Pending
• Disbursement cannot proceed without valid repayment channel
• Action: Re-initiate mandate link; verify bank account is active
• Resolution time: 2-3 business days after mandate success

REASON 2: Document Incomplete or Pending Verification
• Missing fee invoice, demand letter, or institute confirmation
• Name mismatch between PAN/Aadhaar and admission letter
• Action: Submit Affidavit of Identity if name mismatch; get institute demand letter
• Resolution: 3-5 days after document receipt

REASON 3: CIBIL or Credit Check Issue
• New default detected in co-applicant or student credit report
• CIBIL refresh required but not done
• Action: Resolve any outstanding dues; wait for CIBIL update (7-14 days)
• Escalation: Tier 2 if delay exceeds 12 hours

REASON 4: PAN-Aadhaar Not Linked
• RBI mandate: PAN must be linked to Aadhaar for financial transactions
• Transaction will fail at bank processing
• Action: Student/co-applicant must link PAN on incometax.gov.in
• Resolution: Same day after linking

REASON 5: Institute Bank Details or Fee Confirmation Pending
• University has not provided fee breakdown or bank account
• Fee structure changed after sanction
• Action: Obtain revised demand letter from institute
• Resolution: 2-5 days depending on institute response

REASON 6: Margin Money or Top-Up Not Paid
• For loans above unsecured limit, margin (5-15%) must be paid first
• Action: Pay margin to institute or as per sanction letter
• Resolution: 1-2 days after margin receipt

REASON 7: LRS Limit Exceeded (International Loans)
• Student has already remitted > $250,000 USD in current financial year
• Action: Verify LRS utilization; disbursement may be deferred to next FY
• Escalation: Compliance team

REASON 8: Post-Dated Cheques (PDC) Not Received
• Required for unsecured loans in some cases
• Action: Submit PDCs to branch; physical verification may delay
• Resolution: 3-5 days after PDC receipt and validation

4. Escalation Matrix
• Tier 1 (Branch/Relationship Manager): Standard queries, document follow-up
• Tier 2 (Regional Ops): Delay > 7 days, e-NACH/reconciliation issues
• Tier 3 (Central Ops/Compliance): Delay > 15 days, regulatory or FEMA issues

5. Customer Action Checklist for Delayed Disbursement
1. Verify e-NACH/mandate status in net banking
2. Ensure PAN is linked to Aadhaar
3. Confirm all documents submitted and acknowledged
4. Check if institute has sent fee demand letter
5. Contact branch with loan reference number for status
6. Escalate to customer care if no response in 7 days
